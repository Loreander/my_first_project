        My name is Timothy Lynch and I was born and raised in Colchester VT. I currently live in Milton Vermont with my wife Christine
        and my dog Sawyer. Up until June of this year I was an educator at Milton High School. I am currently enrolled in
        the Burlington Code Academy and hope to one day work as a developer in Vermont.

    <p>I consider myself to be a lifelong learner. I love to learn new things and challenge myself as often as possible. I have
        been going to school continuously for 25 years and now that I have completed my Master's Degree and additional credits
        I am looking for my next great adventure. In June of 2018 I said goodbye to my colleagues of eight years at Milton
        High School. I am currently enrolled in Burlington Code Academy and have hopes of finding a position as a web-developer
        before years end.
