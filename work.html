  <h3>Math Teacher - August 2010-June 2018</h3>


  <p> I have been working at Milton High School for the past eight years. As a math educator I have taught Algebra, Geometry,
    Statistics, Algebra II, and AP Calculus. My experiences also include being a team leader, graduation speaker, and a coach.
    As a team leader I organized and facilitated cross-curricular meetings that focused on student needs and improving the
    learning community. I have coached the Golf Team (2017), Math Team (2011-2018), and Ultimate Frisbee Team (2017-2018).
    I have been nominated for teacher of the year for the past two years. As an educator I had to work in a team setting,
    meet the needs of my 'clients', and work in a constantly changing landscape.</p>

  <h3>Colchester School Board - August 2009- June 2010</h3>

  <p>As a senior member of the student planning team I was also selected to be a student member of the Colchester School Board.
    Although I was a non-voting member of the school board I learned all about the intricate relationships that exist between
    community, school board, and teachers/staff. This experience still proves to be an important lens to look through now
    that I am an educator but also a member of the community in which I teach. </p>

  <h3>Restaurant Employee / Manager - March 2004-January 2010</h3>

  <p> New York Pizza Oven in Colchester was my first job as a high school student. After a few years I became a manager of the
    restaurant and would open/close while advising the owner on scheduling and hiring decisions. Having this level of responsibility
    at a young age was crucial to improving my work ethic and realizing how small businesses function. </p>
