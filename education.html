      <h3>Post-Graduate</h3>
      <p>Once I completed my Master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction I looked to complete my +30 by taking a variety of
        education classes through learnersedge.com. Learner's Edge was a great fit for a full-time educator that was looking
        to take classes during school and over the summer. I was able to complete ten classes over the past two years in
        a variety of topics including technology integration, student motivation, arts integration, and brain research. </p>

      <h3>Graduate</h3>
      <p> From 2011-2015 I took classes with local educators at a Southern New Hampshire University satellite campus. The program
        was targetted at educator's that were focused on getting their Master's degree while teaching full time. My action
        research project was the culmination of my Master's Degree and was focused on the topic of growth mindsets vs. fixed
        mindsets. You can see me Prezi discussing my action research project

      <h3>Under-Graduate</h3>
      <p> For my post-secondary education I spent a year at North Carolina State majoring in Mathematics and Education. During
        my sophomore year I transferred from the NCSU to the University of Vermont. I graduated from UVM in the spring of
        2010 with a degree in Secondary Education and a focus in mathematics. </p>

      <h3>High School</h3>
      <p> I attended Colchester High School in Vermont from 2006-2010. At Colchester I was a member of the Math Team, Student
        Planning Team, Student Representative on the School Board, and filmed the Varsity Soccer team during my senior year.
        During my years at CHS I discovered a passion for helping others, problem solving, and mathematics.</p>
